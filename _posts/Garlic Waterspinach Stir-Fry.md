(Serves 3)

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Has
there ever been a time where you just didn’t feel like having a heavy dinner of
meat and potatoes? Or you just felt like you needed to increase your daily
intake of vegetables? Well, water spinach is just one of those greens leafy
vegetable that is healthy, packed with vitamin A, easy to prepare, a pleasure
to eat and doesn’t make you feel like you’re on a diet! It’s good enough to
stand alone or be served with other proteins to make a balanced meal. I love
mine lightly stir-fried, accompanied with <u>Scallion Fried Eggs</u> and some
rice. </p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>This
was actually one of the first dishes I made for my husband after we got married
and he has been hooked ever since. He loves the garlic aroma wafting through
the kitchen when I make this dish. It draws him in like a moth to a flame! For
a sample dinner menu, I usually serve this with <u>Scallion Fried Eggs</u> and
the <a href="http://www.fobesfamily.com/blog/tomato-water-spinach-soup/">Tomato Water Spinach Soup</a> and a side of rice. Instead of cooking the
water spinach through for the soup I just blanch it to infuse the broth with
flavor and then use the blanched water spinach and stir-fry it per this recipe.
The only difference in the recipe is the decreased cooking time. </p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Just
a tip when cooking this dish; if the water spinach is being overcooked it will
start turning brown. &nbsp;Also, blanched water spinach will turn dark brown if
exposed to air for too long so be sure to shock it in ice cold water to stop
the cooking process and cover to prevent browning. I hope you enjoy this dish
as much as my family and I!</p>
