<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span> Happy Lunar New Year everyone! Well, it's officially on Monday; the year of the Monkey. Today
I have for you, Caramelized Coconut Pork Belly and Eggs. I have yet to meet anyone
who does not like this dish. But then again, what’s not to like? Let’s be real
here, you’re obviously not going to be eating this dish everyday if you plan on
being healthy but for those special occasions you just have to be a little more
decadent. This is a traditional dish served during Tet, Vietnamese Lunar New
Year. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that pickled items are also a Tet
tradition as Pickled Mustard Greens pairs so well with this dish. When I don’t
have any on hand, plain cucumber pieces will also do the trick. </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span></span> I know,
pork belly and bacon is the rave right now. But I have been enjoying pork belly
way before it has become a fad. I am unsure about other cultures, but for
Vietnamese cuisine, pork is widely used and pork belly is a prized cut for so
many reasons. The perfect layers of meat and fat when cooked is
mouth-wateringly soft with flavors words can not express.

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>There’s
nothing about this dish that I do not like, from the color to the flavors, nothing
I’d want to change. The brown caramel color is like candy for your eyes while
the fragrance of the sauce just lures you in. And the salty and sweet flavors
keep you wanting more! For those who would like to make this a bit healthier,
you can refrigerate the dish and skim off the fat that consolidates at the top
to make this dish healthier. But do remember that fat is flavor so do leave
some for your palate’s enjoyment!</span></p>
