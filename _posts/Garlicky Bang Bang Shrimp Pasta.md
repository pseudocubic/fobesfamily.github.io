<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>I
can’t believe that I have been working on this food blog for almost 5 months
now and still have yet to post a pasta recipe! Well, that will change today. As
requested I have for you the recipe for my Garlicky Bang Bang Shrimp Pasta. &nbsp;I
have made this dish quite a few times now as I was never completely satisfied with
the consistency and color of the sauce. I felt that the sauce was too creamy
causing the color and texture to suffer as a result. However, today’s version
was exactly what I wanted. The color is more of a vibrant red and the coated
pasta while still creamy has a smooth texture.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>The
spicy shrimp causes me to reminisce about the time period when I was still
living in New Orleans with my husband. It was really the first time in our
relationship where we could freely go out and experience everything together.
It was also a time where we went out and frequented many mom and pop
restaurants to experience the local cuisine. I suppose, according to many, New
Orleans is a great place for these kind of adventures and we do not disagree.
We surely ate well the years that we were there. </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Of
course I needed a vegetable to go with this dish and okra seemed to be the
answer. I served <u>Crispy Oven-Baked Okra</u> to get another food group on the
table. (Recipe coming soon.) I hope you will enjoy the Garlicky Bang Bang
Shrimp Pasta as much as my family. My poor little Evie was puffing a little
from the spice but still asked for more... I guess a little heat never hurt
anyone yeah? </span></p>
