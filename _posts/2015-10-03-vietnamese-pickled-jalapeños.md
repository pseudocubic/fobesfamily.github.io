<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Lately,
I have been in a pickling mood as it is a great way to preserve fresh produce.
You can just put in the effort to make one large batch and enjoy the results
for months! Hey, with a toddler in tow, this is the kind of stuff that makes my
heart skip a beat. Also, pickled dishes serve as a great accompaniment to a
large array of dishes in Vietnamese cuisine. I can cook one or two dishes,
break out the pickled products and it looks like I slaved over a feast! Or if
I’m just in one of those moods, I can just make some rice and enjoy a meal with
some pickled goodies.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Vietnamese
Pickled Jalapeños goes great in Bánh Mì, Sunny-side up eggs with Rice,
Vietnamese Ramen (Mì), Hu Tiu…
basically, whatever you want. I find it is one of the best ways to spice up a
soupy meal without detracting from the flavor of the broth.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>So while jalapeños were in
season, I went to the local
store and purchased a little extra for my pickling needs. Besides, produce in season are always priced better
right? But on top of being priced better, they are at the peak of flavor and
freshness; the best way to create a superior pickled product. Don’t worry if
you’ve never pickled before, this method is so simple and easy. Just let time
take its course and enjoy!</p>
