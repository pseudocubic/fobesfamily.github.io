wonton is one of my sister’s favorites so every time I come home she likes to
request that I make enough for a little stock in the freezer. Not a problem,
except she has certain peculiarities about what she likes in her wontons and
sometimes I need to jog my memory if I have been away for too long as I make it
differently for myself. I also don’t make wontons often since they are a little
time consuming, but when I do I make gigantic batches!</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Well,
I’ve decided to finally write down my filling recipe as I slowly recreate them.
So today I am posting the version I like to serve at home for my family. Shrimp
wontons are actually pretty simple and do not call for very many ingredients
which is always a nice change. I like to serve mine in a simple homemade broth
as a wonton soup, but you can always make a nice bowl of wonton ramen or serve
it on it’s own with your choice of dipping sauce. Some soy sauce with a splash
of vinegar will totally do the trick.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>I
have pictured here, the brand of wonton wrappers that I used. This is my
favorite brand if I plan on serving the wontons in a broth as the wrappers are
extremely thin and delicate. However, being so delicate, it is best to only
boil or deep-fry these wontons as they would not hold up well steamed and tend to fall apart if pan-fried like I do in my Pork Gyoza recipe. If you want to pre-peel the wrappers be sure to keep
it covered until use or it will dry out fairly quickly as the wrappers are
exceptionally thin. Can’t find this brand at your local store? You can go with
another brand or make your own =) One of these days I will have to make a post
on making your own homemade wonton wrappers…</span></p>
