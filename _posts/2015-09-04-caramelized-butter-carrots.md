<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Growing
up I was never a fan of carrots. It was a good thing I had siblings that would
take them off hands. Granted I didn’t mind the presence of carrots since I’ve
always thought they made the dishes look beautiful with their vibrant
orange-red color and the essence it left in the soups was delightful to savor
so long as I didn’t need to consume the carrot itself. This however, changed
after my husband introduced me to Caramelized Butter Carrots, a dish he had
enjoyed at home many times through out the year prior to our marriage. </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>I
think it’s a safe bet to say many of you are fans of butter right? My mother
was a major butter fan thanks to the French colonization of Vietnam. Let’s just
say she has instilled this love for butter in me as well. I suppose that’s why
this dish just spoke to my heart. Simple and easy to prepare, and everything
required for this dish is probably just sitting in your refrigerator as a
standard stock! It makes for a great side dish anytime of the year.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Since
this dish is so basic, flavored only by butter and salt, it is meant to promote
the natural sweetness and taste of the carrot itself. So it is very important
to use fresh carrots, not the frozen or pre-sliced bags. The better the carrot
quality, the better the dish. I’m all for the convenience of not having to peel
and slice or dice to shave some time from cooking but this is one of those
instances where you can really tell the difference in the quality of the
ingredients used.</span></p>
