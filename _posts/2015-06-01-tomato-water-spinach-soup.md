Simplicity can yield amazing results. Growing up, I have always loved eating soup. The hot broth slowly warms you up from the inside, giving you a cozy feeling especially on those cold winter days. This Tomato-Water Spinach Soup has always been a childhood favorite. Ubiquitous in Vietnam and known as peasant food; to me it is the culmination of the phrase, “necessity is the mother of invention”. A combination of salty and sour with a pungent garlicky aroma, this dish hits all the right notes. Simple and cheap to make as well as a whole meal in one pot, there is no downside to me. You can just serve this soup with the boiled water spinach and rice (and you can not forget the dipping sauce- fish sauce with cut up red thai chili, which is a must have for a complete table when serving a Vietnamese meal). However, sometimes I like to dress up the water spinach and make it into **Garlic Water Spinach Stir-fry** and then accompany the meal with **Scallion Fried Eggs**!
