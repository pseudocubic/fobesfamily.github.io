<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Growing
up in Southern California, char siu is not exactly hard to come by. Go down the
block and a handful of places have their own version to sell. However, that is
no longer a luxury I can enjoy. I suppose it’s a blessing in disguise since it
forces me to learn how to make my own version and have another post for my
blog! </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Char
Siu is highly popular in Asian Cuisine, served in so many different ways. Each
country seems to have their own take on how to make it. A succulent roast, the
pork can be steamed in buns, served over noodles, accompanied with rice or
stuffed in sandwiches; the presentations are endless but one thing holds true,
it is delicious!&nbsp; </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>The
recipe version that I have here is rather straight-forward. Make the marinade,
marinate, and then roast. I admit, I did cheat a little in this recipe and used
a prepackaged marinade mix that I slightly enhanced. What can I say, there’s
just some of those lazy days I just want to go the easy route in the kitchen.
Surely I’m not the only one. Don’t worry, the end result is still wonderfully delightful.
</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Your
house will smell heavenly while the pork fat renders in the oven and the meat
takes on the beautiful reddish-pink color with splashes of black charring on
the meat. Have some pickled veggies ready or just a plate of sliced cucumbers
on hand with rice and your meal is complete. The leftovers make a great hot
lunch for the next day too! </span></p>
