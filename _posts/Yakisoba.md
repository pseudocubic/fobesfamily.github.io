<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>So
this week my husband had requested Yakisoba for dinner as I haven’t made it in
quite some time. This just gave me an opportunity to finally jot down another
recipe as well as save me the trouble of deciding what to cook for dinner.
Sometimes I just get into a food rut and have no idea what I want to make. I’m
sure everyone has felt this way at some point or another right?</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Yakisoba
is basically the Japanese version of Mì Xào (Vietnamese Egg Noodle Stir-fry).
I’m not saying that it’s a rip-off, but the concept is extremely similar. And
being a lover of noodles, I have no problem adding another noodle recipe to my
repertoire. Once all the ingredients are prepared, you can get this noodle
dinner on the table in less than 15 minutes. When I was still working I would
prep all the ingredients beforehand so I could just come home from work and
make this quickly for dinner. Plus, there’s plenty leftover for lunch the next
day! </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>When
I first started making this dish I loosely followed the recipe from “basic
Japanese cooking including sushi, sashimi and yakitori” by Jody Vassallo. I say
loosely follow because I really do have a problem with executing a recipe
exactly as written. This is also a big reason as to why it took me so long to
start a blog since I never wanted to measure anything out. I was taught to cook
to taste and that’s what I have always done, and still do (Unless, of course,
it’s for my blog recipes, then I make sure to be exact with my measurements). </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Since
I was not familiar with the seasoning used to create the flavor of Yakisoba, I
needed a point of reference and this book was useful in that perspective. My
first go around I would usually stay pretty close to the recipe and just adjust
the seasoning. But as the years have gone by since my first attempt at yakisoba
I have gotten more comfortable with this dish and the recipe slowly morphed
into what it is here. Bean sprout is a large component for a good yakisoba, but
for some reason it’s hard to come by where I live, hence I usually have to
leave it out. But please do add it at the end of the cooking process if you are
able to get some. For reasons, like this, I’m sure a few years from now I will
be posting a different version of a Yakisoba recipe as I always like to improve
on my dishes and use readily available ingredients. </span></p>
