<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span>(13 skewers)</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>It's Labor Day Weekend and I
just realized that summer is almost at an end and I have yet to post any
barbeque recipes, yikes! I think everyone loves to break out the grill and
going outside to enjoy the beautiful weather during this time of the year.
Isn’t it great to have sunlight at 8:00 at night? I remember feeling so much
better leaving work in Long Island, NY when the sun was still out even though I
was still working the same amount of time. (During the winter months I would lose
the sun around 5:00 pm!!!) </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Alas,
grills were not permitted in our apartment complex so the summers came and went
with us not being able to enjoy outdoor cooking. That being said, we’ve recently
moved to our new home this year with a large backyard and patio area, so of
course we plan on over using our newly purchased propane grill this summer! I
know, grilling with propane doesn’t give you that charcoal satisfaction. But to
be perfectly honest, I enjoy not having to take 15-20 minutes to get the grill
ready with the charcoal and then having to clean up the residual ashes on top
of the grill itself. </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Usually,
I like to marinate some chicken thighs or drumsticks and pop them on the grill.
However, it has been ages since I’ve made “meat-on-a-stick” as my husband would
call it so I decided to make chicken skewers with the chicken breast left over
from my other culinary escapades. As a lover of dark meat, normally I would
debone chicken thighs for this recipe as I find it to be more moist and
flavorful. On that note, be careful not too overcook the chicken breast or
it’ll become dry. </span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span>Who
doesn’t like some food on a stick right? It travels well for when I am chasing
Evie around the yard trying to keep her out of trouble. I adore the color
contrast on the skewers and the flavors are so complimentary. Although
skewering everything does take a little time, I find it can spark some creative
fun as well as a great way to have a lively chat during cooking parties. I
think next time I will be getting the larger asparagus to make skewering a
little easier. As always, I hope you enjoy this recipe and please let me know
what you think!</span></p>
